                    <p>Mary Johnson, 42, was at her wit’s end. She loved her three sons more than life itself. They were all bright boys, ranging from freshmen to seniors in high school. But lately she had less-than-pleasant thoughts toward them. She had fantasies about cutting all their feet off.</p>
                    <p>See, her boys were all athletes. Two of them were on the varsity football team, while the third was becoming a great young soccer player. And after practice every day they’d come home, put their shoes on the shoe rack, and fight over who showered first.</p>
                    <p>“That shoe rack,” Mary says, “became the bane of my existence.”</p>
                    <p>The shoe rack was starting to smell. Bad. What’s worse, it was situated on the landing, so you had to pass it when you came into the house.</p>
                    <p>“I swear the smell turned the food rotten when I walked in with groceries,” Mary says. My daughter Katie, she’s eight, she threw up because of the smell. She literally threw up all in the landing. It was that bad.”</p>
                    <p>It was a problem that had to be dealt with. So Mary tried all the usual “remedies.”</p>
                    <p>“I tried everything,” Mary says. “Everything! Baking soda? Nope! Spray? Ha! I even got so desperate that I bought car fresheners and put one in each individual shoe.”</p>
                    <p>With seemingly no way out, Mary’s foot-severing fantasies begun. But little did she know, hope was right around the corner. Literally.</p>
                    <p>“My neighbor knocked on my door and when I opened it she took a step back and gagged,” Mary says. “She asked, ‘Lord what is that smell?’”</p>
                    <p>“I was so embarrassed,” Mary says. “But then I heard a knock on the door two minutes later. I thought, ‘Oh no, she called Child Services on me.’”</p>
                    <p>But the neighbor was back, this time holding what appeared to be a grey beanbag. The neighbor pinched her nose, stepped over to the shoe rack, tossed it in, and rushed back outside. Then she turned to Mary and, before leaving, said two words:</p>
                    <p>“Trust me.”</p>
                    <p>“Well,” Mary says, “it worked. The next morning I prepared myself for that awful smell when I went to get the newspaper. When I walked by— I couldn’t believe my nose. The intense smell that punished me day in and day out... It wasn’t completely gone. BUT, if I had to put a number on it I would say the intensity was cut down by 50% right off the bat. And by the end of the week I had to bend my nose down toward the rack and take in a deep breath to smell anything. I have no idea how it worked, but I had to know what that bag was, so I checked it out. It said ‘Breathe Green’ on the label.”</p>
                    <p>“I couldn’t believe it,” she said. I bought four right then. I put this thing next to my husband’s gym clothes and the smell started to fade from them, as well. I put it beside the garbage and the funky scents began to dissipate from there, too. I have no idea how it works, and I don’t need to. All I know is that it does.”</p>

                    The clever little trick (backed by science) that cleanses the air inside your home…
                </h1>

                    The Breathe Green Charcoal comes in the form of a bag and is the easiest, most convenient way to maintain a fresh, dry and odor free environment. Made of just one incredibly powerful natural ingredient, activated bamboo charcoal, the Breathe Green Charcoal Bag is continuously working to effectively absorb and reduce odors, allergens and harmful pollutants and to clean and freshen <span style="white-space:nowrap;">the air.<sup><small>[3]</small></sup></span>
                    <p>The activated bamboo charcoal neutralizes even stubborn smells, such as those caused by smoke, pet urine, cat litter boxes, wet dogs, gym shoes and more. The Breathe Green Charcoal Bag is also excellent for use in damp, musty environments, where it will absorb excess moisture to prevent mold, mildew and bacteria from <span style="white-space:nowrap;">forming.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <p>And unlike harsh chemical deodorizers and sprays, the <a class="articleLink" href="<?php echo $link ?>" onclick="fbq('trackCustom','CTA');" target="_blank">Breathe Green Charcoal Bag</a> is a chemical free, fragrance free and non-toxic natural odor absorber that keeps you and your pets <span style="white-space:nowrap;">safe.<sup><small>[1]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <p>Best of all, it’s super easy to use. Simply place the bag on any surface and it will start purifying the air around it for up to 90 square feet and lasts up to 2 years.</p>

                <h1>
                    With thousands and thousands of bags sold, we had to try it out for ourselves…
                </h1>

                    <p>We’ve read the thousands of positive reviews raving about this product, but in order for us to truly believe it, we had to test it out for ourselves. So, we ordered a bunch of Breathe Green Charcoal Bags (which arrived at our door 3 days later) and started conducting tests.</p>
                    <h3>Test 1: The Smelly Trash Can</h3>
                    <p>We wanted to see if the Breathe Green Charcoal Bags could beat the stinky odors around a trash can. We threw all kinds of smelly food in the trash and let it sit for a few days. After a few days, food started to rot and the smell was pretty unbearable. We then placed a Breathe Green Charcoal Bag next to the trash can.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> After leaving the bag next to the trash can for 24 hours, we came back and were amazed to already find almost no foul stench coming from around the trash can. The best part was that it wasn’t like using a scented deodorizer to mask the smell, but instead, the air just quickly began to smell fresh and on its way to quickly becoming odorless. Just a couple of days later we had the great results we were looking <span style="white-space:nowrap;">for.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <h3>Test 2: Smoking Indoors</h3>
                    <p>For our next test, we wanted to see if the <a class="articleLink" href="<?php echo $link ?>" onclick="fbq('trackCustom','CTA');" target="_blank">Breathe Green Charcoal Bags</a> could stand up to the harsh smell of cigarettes being smoked indoors. We conducted the test in a 500 square foot living room by putting 4 bags in each corner of the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">room.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> After smoking 1 cigarette and 24 hours later, we entered the living room and to our amazement, there was very little residue of cigarette smoke in the room. It was simply amazing!</p>
                    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> By the end of the week the living room was virtually odorless, but it is important to note that we could smell traces of cigarette smoke when we walked through other parts of the house that did not have the bags. If you want your entire house covered, you should get enough bags to place throughout your house.</p>
                    <h3>Test 3: The Bathroom/Shower</h3>
										<p>We took this next experiment to the bathroom where there is naturally a lot of moisture and mold/mildew growing. We placed just one bag in the bathroom while we turned up a hot shower for about 30 minutes several times a day, with all doors and windows shut so moisture could not escape. For 3 straight days, we repeated this process, each time keeping the doors and windows shut.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Experts say that it usually takes 24-48 hours for mold and mildew to start growing. After putting the bags through a rigorous 3-day test, we checked back each day to see if there was any presence of mold or mildew growing. Again, the results were amazing… no mold or mildew to be found anywhere! The bathroom did not even feel humid at all so we assume that the bag did its job by sucking up all the moisture, and thus successfully preventing mold from growing.</p>
                    <h3>Test 4: Doggy Daycare Facility</h3>
										<p>Our last test took place in a doggy daycare facility. With 18 dogs running around, naturally the facility had very strong dog odors. We placed about 30 bags throughout the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">facility.<sup><small>[4]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> We came back 24 hours later and although we could still smell just a hint of dog odor throughout the facility, there was a HUGE improvement. This was an extreme case, and if used in a normal household environment with 1 or 2 dogs, we are confident that the Breathe Green Charcoal Bag would be able to combat these pet odors with no problem.</p>
                <h1>
                    Our Final Thoughts
                </h1>
                    <p>After conducting several tests, we are able to confirm that these Breathe Green Charcoal Bags really do work as well as everyone says. To be honest, we haven’t seen anything like this on the market, and are truly blown away by how well it works. Whether you are looking to purify the air in your house, prevent mold from growing or protecting yourself from unpleasant odors, we would highly recommend <a class="articleLink" href="<?php echo $link ?>" onclick="fbq('trackCustom','CTA');" target="_blank">buying a few Breathe Green Charcoal Bags </a> to try out for <span style="white-space:nowrap;">yourself.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup></span></p>
										<p>But don’t take our word for it. Listen to a mother who knows what it can do.</p>
										<p>“Trust me,” says Mary Johnson. “If this thing can cleanse my shoe rack of that putrid smell, it will take care of pretty much any kind of odor you’re dealing with. The fact is, it just works.”</p>
                    <p><span style="color: #d00; font-weight: bold;">*Update: <?=date('F j, Y');?>*</span> - Ever since the <a class="articleLink" href="<?php echo $link ?>" onclick="fbq('trackCustom','CTA');" target="_blank">Breathe Green Charcoal Bags</a> were featured on TV, an incredible amount of buzz has been generated and has since sold many thousands of bags.
