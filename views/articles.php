                    Take a cruise through the rooms in your home. I'm sure you'll find some offensive odors. You might have indoor pets (litter box or dog's bed) or used athletic shoes and clothes. Maybe you can still smell the last fish fry from the most recent fishing trip, or your bathroom never seems to dry out, and that mildew smell just won't go away.

                    Negative air ions (NAIs) are not a new discovery &ndash; they were discovered over 100 years ago! NAI generators are currently easily purchased for either home or industrial use. You may know some people who are fanatical about keeping the windows spotless and the floors so clean you could eat off them in their home, but in the end, the air in a house determines its cleanliness. <i>If the air is dirty, everything else inside is too.</i>

                    Climate change is something that we can no longer ignore or deny. When we talk about climate change, we are referring to the shifting of what is expected of the atmospheric pattern. This usually occurs over several millennia. However in recent times, it has been engineered as a result of both natural processes and human activities.
