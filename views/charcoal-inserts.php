            <p class="page-heading page-heading--small line-before font-weight-bold" style="text-transform: none;">Dear
              Reader,</p>
            <div class="pl-4">

<p>By now you've likely already heard in the news and know the benefits of bamboo charcoal as an all-natural odor controller.</p>
 
<p>Our Breathe Green Charcoal Air Purifying Bags work to continuously absorb moisture and pollutants. This is what contributes to fresher and cleaner smelling air, as opposed to the chemical deodorizers, candles, gels, pumps and sprays that you've likely been buying for years. Unfortunately, these other methods are not healthy for people and not good for the planet.</p>
 
<p>When our charcoal air purifiers absorb the excess moisture and pollutants in your environment this prevents mold, mildew and bacteria from forming in your personal items, your home, office, car and everywhere else in your life.</p>
 
<p class="page-heading page-heading--small pl-0" style="line-height: 1.5; text-transform: none;">You already know you need charcoal purifying bags to help protect against the unhealthy air which can affect your respiratory system, your blood and lung health, plus leave you experiencing more energy and feeling much healthier in the process.</p>
 
<p>But maybe you didn't realize that these charcoal bags can be used in places you might not have previously thought possible to help control the mold and bacteria that cause the stinky odors associated with your items that are “well known” for smelling foul and funky.</p>
 
<p>With our new smaller, “thinner” sized bags you will be able to tone down those terrible smells that always seem to creep up in your personal items such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sneakers and gym bags</li>
<li>Dress shoes</li>
<li>Work boots</li>
<li>Winter boots</li>
<li>Hiking boots</li>
<li>Ski boots</li>
<li>Your children's sporting equipment</li>
<li>Boxing gloves</li>
<li>Hockey gloves</li>
<li>Lacrosse gloves</li>
<li>Ice skates</li>
<li>Your car (takes up less space than a traditional charcoal bag)</li>
<li>Your closets (takes up less space than a traditional charcoal bag)</li>
<li>Behind and underneath furniture cushions</li>
<li>Under car seats</li>
<li>Bookshelves</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

            <div class="pl-4">

							<center>
							<img src="images/infographic.jpg" class="img-fluid">
							</center>
              <p>Bad smells come from tiny molecules. The bamboo charcoal in the Breathe Green Air Purifiers absorbs these “smelly” molecules and helps transition them into what might be described as “fresh scent” molecules.</p>
							<p>It's really simple, powerful, and totally effective.</p>

							<p>The same scientific principles that apply with our standard sized charcoal purifying pouches also stand with our versatile, thinner bags:</p>
<ol>
<li>The activated charcoal reduces odors and doesn't just mask the smell.</li>
<li>Keeps both people and pets safer from harmful residues.</li>
<li>Contributes to the prevention of MOLD, MILDEW and BACTERIA formation by SOAKING UP excess moisture.</li>
<li>Works continuously to absorb and reduce allergens and harmful pollutants to keep the air and your personal items smelling fresh and clean.</li>
<li>Neutralizes even stubborn smells caused by smoke, pet urine, cat litter boxes, wet dogs, gym shoes and more.</li>
<li>Works especially well in damp, musty environments.</li>

						<ul>
<li>One mother in update New York let us know that <b>she was literally choking on the strong, putrid smell coming from her son's hockey bag</b>. After placing the thinner Breathe Green charcoal bags in his gloves and skates, in just a few days <b>the smell was reduced to the point that it hardly bothered her at all</b>.</li>
<li>A prominent businessman wrote to tell us that these skinny charcoal bags <b>absorbed the moisture out of his shoes so that they maintained much better, lasted longer, and look extra sharp</b>! And the foul smell was already neutralized from the shoes in less than 36 hours.</li>
<li>A father in Georgia was having major problems sitting in his own car. He was <b>constantly sneezing and he couldn't stand the smell inside the car…</b> until he put the smaller, more discreet Breathe Green Air Purifiers in the car and <b>the sneezing came to a near halt while the bad smell dissipated rather quickly</b>.</li>
<li>A young woman in Kentucky was beyond thankful for her charcoal bags because they <b>absorbed and softened the odor from urine and fecal matter produced by her pets in her small apartment</b>.</li>

							"I got these Charcoal Bags for my daughter's shoes in her dance bag. In years prior her bag smelled like a nasty gym locker. I thought I had no choice in the matter and this was just part of the “dance life”. I'm soooo happy to say that these bags work beautifully. Candice makes her mom very proud because she routinely remembers to put the bags back in shoes after each practice. The smell is gone and I could not be more grateful. I'm sure there are plenty of other moms out there who would want to know about these “magic bags”. If you want to keep your child's athletic equipment smelling fresh I do 100% recommend these Breathe Greens."<br>

							"My husband and I put the Breathe Green Charcoal mini bags into every nook and cranny of our house. We have found so many uses for the bags that we kind of joke about wanting to be spokespeople for Breathe Green! So far we have successfully kept what used to be a lingering wet dog smell out of our bedroom and living room. We've also got the funky smells out of our gym bags. And our closets smell SO MUCH fresher since we put a few bags in between our clothes. These things are game changers!"<br>
