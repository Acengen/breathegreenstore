              Reader,</p>
            <div class="pl-4">
<p>Breathe Green PURE is a small, discrete plug-in air purifier designed to combat some of the strongest odors in your home. Bacteria, viruses, pet odors, cigarette smoke, mold, and mildew are all kept in check with the effective purifying combination of activated oxygen and ionization. It's small and compact, and you just simply have to plug it in and you're all set!</p>

<p>Soon you can begin to experience the real possibility of breathing easier again, having more energy and feeling much healthier in the process!</p>

<p>Here’s why:</p>

<p>The earth is charged with negative ions that clean the air and makes it smell great. Have you ever noticed how nice and fresh it smells in the mountains, or at the beach, near a waterfall, or after a rainstorm?<small><sup>[1]</small></sup>
</p>
<p>Well Breathe Green PURE WORKS IN A VERY SIMILAR WAY in that the science behind our product acts as if the PURE is “scrubbing” the air clean by actually creating ions that attach to “odor molecules” in the air you breathe. It doesn’t just cover up odors, it uses scientific principles to NEUTRALIZE THEM!<small><sup>[1]</small></sup>
</p>
<p>We can all agree that outdoor pollution is terrible. But the World Health Organization is now taking a long look at indoor pollution. The organization recently released a study saying that almost 3% of diseases come from poor indoor air quality.<small><sup>[3]</small></sup>
</p>
<p>Foul odors and stale air can of course also be generated from inside your home by cooking, mold, various household cleaners, paint, gas leaks, your pet’s poop, or their respiration and their dander.<small><sup>[4]</small></sup>
</p>
<p>If your whole family is complaining about headaches, feeling sluggish and low energy...
</p>
<p>Or if you’re suffering from hay fever and other seasonal allergies, these air ionizers can actually help relieve tension and even possibly improve sleep patterns.<small><sup>[5]</small></sup>
</p> 
<p>In fact without even realizing it, there is a very good chance that you are dealing with an abundance of positive ions in your home. BUT, in this case positive = no good!<small><sup>[6]</small></sup>
</p>
<p><b>Rest Easier At Night Knowing You And Your Family Can Do Something About Breathing In Toxins As You Sleep</b>
</p>
<p>Scientists explain that air ionizers rely on the chemical properties of ions. Air ionizers create negative ions using electricity and then discharge them into the air. These negative ions attach to positively charged particles in the room, such as dust, bacteria, pollen, smoke, and other allergens. The positively charged particles and negative ions bond together to create dense dirt particles that cannot float in <span style="white-space:nowrap;">the air.<small><sup>[1]</small></sup></span>
</p>
<p>This is the science that can make your room, living room, the kitchen and your childrens’ bedrooms begin to smell beautifully fresh and clean again!

		<p>These include…</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Asbestos</li>

		<p>Indoor pollutants can have a really bad impact on your short-term and long-term health. Take a <span style="white-space:nowrap;">look…<small><sup>[4]</small></sup></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sneezing</li>

		<p>And that’s a short list. Long-term health problems can include respiratory diseases, heart issues, and even cancer.</p>
		<p>We breathe 15,000 liters of air every day. The pollution from inside our homes gets into our bloodstream through our lungs, even if we’re healthy.</p>

<p>What can the Breathe Green PURE air ionizer do for you? Take a look.</p>

<p><b>Two cousins who are asthmatic have always suffered from sneezing, teary eyes, wheezing, and coughing</b>. Once their aunt explained to their mother how she had been using these oxygen activators, she bought several Breathe Green PURE air purifiers, and <b>sure enough, the cousins began to see their problems fade away</b>. That’s because the ionizing power of Breathe Green PURE acted as a “scrub” to help support “cleaning” the air of all allergens, toxins, pollen, and other particulate matter, like <span style="white-space:nowrap;">dust.<small><sup>[1]</small></sup></span></p>

<p>Or what about the BG PURE user who lives in a house where <b>his parents smoke, and he couldn’t stand the smell?</b> It always smelled like stale tobacco. He ordered a couple of Breathe Green PURE ionizers, and <b>now he says his house smells so much better</b>. He keeps one in his room to keep the tobacco smell <span style="white-space:nowrap;">neutralized<small><sup>[1]</small></sup></span> and the Breathe Green PURE even helped to dissipate the clouds of smoke that lingered.</p>

<p>If you have a dusty environment or problem with pollen, this could be a powerful solution that can help keep your home clean. <b>When bonding to the Breathe Green PURE’s positive ions dust and particles literally drop out of the air!</b> Your indoor environment can soon start to become fresh and super <span style="white-space:nowrap;">clean!<small><sup>[8]</small></sup></span></p>

The day I got them, we had plumbers working on a sewer pipe in our basement. We had a lot of sewer gas in the bathroom so I plugged in a Breathe Green PURE. Within a short time the smell was gone! Unbelievable! It's incredible the amount and space that they purify! Our home smells fresh and clean. We also really like the fact that they are small enough to stick into a suitcase to travel with. Another product making a HAPPY customer!&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;The Breathe Green PURE may be small, but it is mighty! I moved into my townhouse and the last owner was a smoker, so the entire house smelled like cigarettes and was musty. I tried every air freshener under the sun. Finally, I found Breathe Green PURE Air Purifiers and everything changed. When I got my first one, I just plugged it in to an open, uncovered outlet in the living room and it was all set! Within 24 hours, the downstairs smelled clean and there was no more cigarette stink. After that, I went online and bought 3 more, one for my kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. After 48 hours of them all plugged in, my entire house smelled clean and fresh. The best part about them is that you don't have to change air filters or replace bulbs or throw it out after a certain time period. These purifiers are the best investment I made for my house and I recommend them to anyone looking to purify the air in their house!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>You’ll need as many purifiers for as many areas that you’d like to treat. Simply plug in the PURE air ionizers into a standard outlet in one or multiple rooms. Whether it’s your office, bedrooms, living room, kitchen, playrooms, hallways, garage, basement and anywhere else you suspect you might be affected by questionable air quality just plug them in and forget about it - No need to replace expensive filters. Many customers want to be sure the air at their workplace is fresh and then also start out with their bedroom and kitchen. But depending on your situation you can start with more, or less.</p>
