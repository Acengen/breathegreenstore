                              <h2>I Discovered the Amazing and Easy Way to Get Cleaner, Ionized Air!</h2>
                              <p>One day after school, I went to a pet store to buy some kitty litter 
                                 and cat food for Grandma. It was interesting going into the store. They 
                                 had dozens of cats and dogs, birds, lizards, and even a monkey! And you 
                                 know how bad monkeys can smell. If you’ve ever been to a Monkey House at
                                 the zoo, the smell can knock you out.
                              </p>
                              <p>But here’s the thing, that <b>pet store smelled clean and fresh</b>. There was barely an odor at all! I wondered how they kept the pet store smelling so clean when they had all those animals there.</p>
                              <p><em><strong>“This pet store smells really clean”</strong></em>, I said to the owner. <em><strong>“How do you do it? We have a lot of animals at home and our house smells horrible.”</strong></em></p>
                              <p>The owner smiled. <em><strong>Don’t I know it! This store smelled so bad that I think it was driving away customers. But then I found out from a customer who was an environmental scientist about <a href="<?php echo $link; ?>" target="_blank">BREATHE GREEN PURE</a> Air Purifiers. I bought a few of them, and it was a complete game changer. My store doesn’t even come close to smelling like it used to!”</strong></em>
                              </p>
                              <p><img src="/info/images/img5.jpg" alt="img5" class=" b-loaded" width="" height=""></p>
                              <p><em><strong>“Wow,”</strong></em> I said. <em><strong>“They really work?”</strong></em></p>
                              <p>The store owner told me to think about why the air smells so fresh and clean after a rainstorm. That’s because the earth is charged with negative ions that clean the air and makes it smell great.¹ <strong><a href="<?php echo $link; ?>" target="_blank">THE BREATHE GREEN PURE IONIZER</a> WORKS THE SAME WAY</strong>, releasing these anions into the air and actually bonding with odor molecules to help reduce their presence from the air.¹ It doesn’t just cover up odors, it <b>WORKS TOWARDS NEUTRALIZING THEM AT THE SOURCE</b>
                              </p>
                              <p><img src="/info/images/img6.jpg" alt="img6" class=" b-loaded" width="" height=""></p>
                              <p>He said the scientist explained that air ionizers rely on the 
                                 chemical properties of ions. Air ionizers create negative ions using 
                                 electricity and then discharge them into the air. These negative ions 
                                 attach to positively charged particles in the room, such as dust, 
                                 bacteria, pollen, smoke, and other allergens. The positively charged 
                                 particles and negative ions bond together to create dense dirt particles
                                 that cannot float in the air.¹
                              </p>
                              <p>Many studies show that air ionizers cleanse the air of bacteria, 
                                 dust, cigarette smoke, molds, soot, pollen, and household odors. This 
                                 really helps people suffering from hay fever and other seasonal 
                                 allergies. Air ionizers can actually help relieve tension and improve 
                                 sleep patterns.²
                              </p>
                              <p>The pet shop owner showed me these small little devices that were 
                                 plugged in all around the pet store. They were glowing with a soft blue 
                                 light.

                                    <li>My friend works in a bowling alley, and they have a shoe rental room which he said smells so bad that he has to hold his nose to go in there. It’s full of horrible smelling bowling shoes. BREATHE GREEN PURE cleared up the intensity out  that stink. Now he says he doesn’t have to hold his nose when he goes in there.

                                    <li>One of my friends lives in a house where his parents smoke, and he can’t stand the smell. It always smells like stale tobacco. He ordered a couple of <a href="<?php echo $link; ?>" target="_blank">BREATHE GREEN PURE</a> ionizers, and now he says his house smells so much better. He keeps one in his room and there is never any tobacco smell anymore.

                                    <li>The locker rooms on campus at the gym smell horrendous. I told the Front Desk about <a href="<?php echo $link; ?>" target="_blank">BREATHE GREEN PURE</a>, and they tried out a few in there. Now you don’t have to hold your nose and choke while you’re getting changed after working out. It even works in one of the worst smelling places, a guys’ locker room.
