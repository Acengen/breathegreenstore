<h4><i>Return and Refund Policy</i></h4>
					<p><strong>When are orders processed?</strong></p>
					
					<p>Orders are processed within one business day and shipped to the customer within one to two business days.  Customers will be emailed a confirmation of shipment including a tracking number.</p>
					
					<p><strong>When will I receive my order?</strong></p>
					
					<p>Receipt time for US orders is 5-7 business days.  Delivery delays because of holiday rush, inclement weather, or other unforeseen circumstances is a possibility and are out of Breathe Green&rsquo;s control.  However, it is our priority to have your order delivered as quickly as possible.  </p>
					
					<p><strong>Do you ship internationally and when would I receive my order?</strong></p>
					
					<p>Yes (there is a shipping fee for international shipments).   Normally the delivery time would be 7-10 business days, but receipt of international shipments may be longer due to each country&rsquo;s customs acceptance procedures.</p>
					
					<p><strong>What are your shipping methods?</strong></p>
					
					<p>Our shipping methods include regular service (no express service) with the following carriers:  UPS Mail Innovations, FedEx Smart Post, and the United States Postal Service.  Smaller packages are normally put in your mailbox if shipped United Postal Service, or at the front door or on the front porch if shipped UPS or FedEx.</p>
