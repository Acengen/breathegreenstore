<p><i>Many homes suffer from a variety of nasty smells and odors which affect our quality of life. Here, pet lover and grandmother-of-four, Doris (63), shares how she got rid of pet odors and musty smells from her home&ndash;without giving up her pets or replacing her furniture&hellip;</i></p>

<p>Doris was struggling for years to rid her house of unpleasant odors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a several pets&hellip; a couple dogs and, I admit, probably too many cats. And while they don&rsquo;t shed a whole lot&hellip; they sure can make this place smell,&rdquo; said Doris.</p>

<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just the lingering, husky smells her pets left. <b>No matter how much she cleaned and dusted and vacuumed and washed, her house was still shrouded in a musty fog.</b></p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s us&hellip;or your pets</h2>

<p>&ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m talking about,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;the drapes, my sofa, the wallpaper, my living room rug&hellip; <b>they all had this old, damp smell of mildew and dust that lingered no matter how often I cleaned around here</b>.&rdquo;</p>

                <div class="articleImg">
                    <center><img src="/images/cat-mess3.jpg" width="100%" /></center>
                </div>

<p>As she spoke, Doris dabbed at her eyes, &ldquo;It got so bad my children started making excuses about coming over to visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They think that my house is dirty, and they&rsquo;re afraid that their kids&ndash;my grandkids&ndash;will catch something. Dust, mold or allergies or something like that,&rdquo; she sniffed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I called up my son Tommy and asked why he stopped bringing his kids around, he said I need to throw out all my old furniture and let the shelter take away my pets. It&rsquo;s not hygienic, he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doris was clearly upset. &ldquo;But my house isn&rsquo;t dirty! <b>It&rsquo;s the same fine house him and his two sisters grew up in&ndash;it only <i>smells</i> like it&rsquo;s dirty!</b>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Everything changed one day when her friend dropped by</h2>

<p>Doris was at a loss about what to do, until that one day her friend Rita dropped by for coffee.</p>

&ldquo;When Rita walked in, she was excited. More than normal,&rdquo; said Doris. &ldquo;And as soon as she sat down, she pulled out three of these little gray things&hellip; they looked like little bean bags to me&hellip; from her purse and handed them to me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Rita said these little bags <b><i>are like magic</i>&hellip; that they soak up every single bad odor wafting around the room and make the air clean and fresh again.</b>&rdquo;

<p>Doris continued, &ldquo;She put one behind her sofa, one under her coffee table, and one next to her cat&rsquo;s litter tray and within a day she couldn&rsquo;t smell a thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was so happy and so impressed, she got me some as a gift, too,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;and I put them right away in my living room and hallway, just like she told me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Doris woke up the next morning, she could hardly believe it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was incredible! I couldn&rsquo;t smell a thing! I was so excited I called up Tommy and begged him to come over. I promised the place would be clean to his liking, and he agreed to stop by that very afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

                <div class="articleImg">
                    <center><img src="/images/cat-mess2.jpg" width="100%" /></center>
                </div>

<p>Doris beamed. &ldquo;When Tommy walked in with my grandson in his arms, his face was all screwed up like he was expecting to smell something awful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She chuckled, &ldquo;But in seconds he relaxed and broke out in that crooked grin of his.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; he asked me, &ldquo;what did you do to the place? It&rsquo;s so fresh and clean!&rdquo;</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all started coming back to visit again,&rdquo; Doris smiled proudly. &ldquo;<b>And my home smells clean now like a high-class hotel thanks to these little gray bags.</b>&rdquo;</p>

                    The clever little trick (backed by science) that cleanses the air inside your home&hellip;
                </h2>

                    The Breathe Green Charcoal comes in the form of a bag and is the easiest, most convenient way to maintain a fresh, dry and odor free environment. Made of just one incredibly powerful natural ingredient, activated bamboo charcoal, the Breathe Green Charcoal Bag is continuously working to effectively absorb and reduce odors, allergens and harmful pollutants and to clean and freshen <span style="white-space:nowrap;">the air.<sup><small>[3]</small></sup></span>
                    <p>The activated bamboo charcoal neutralizes even stubborn smells, such as those caused by smoke, pet urine, cat litter boxes, wet dogs, gym shoes and more. The Breathe Green Charcoal Bag is also excellent for use in damp, musty environments, where it will absorb excess moisture to prevent mold, mildew and bacteria from <span style="white-space:nowrap;">forming.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <p>And unlike harsh chemical deodorizers and sprays, the <a class="articleLink" href="<?php echo $link ?>" onclick="fbq('trackCustom','CTA');">Breathe Green Charcoal Bag</a> is a chemical free, fragrance free and non-toxic natural odor absorber that keeps you and your pets <span style="white-space:nowrap;">safe.<sup><small>[1]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <p>Best of all, it&rsquo;s super easy to use. Simply place the bag on any surface and it will start purifying the air around it for up to 90 square feet and lasts up to 2 years.</p>

                <h2>
                    With thousands and thousands of bags sold, we had to try it out for ourselves&hellip;
                </h2>

                    <p>We&rsquo;ve read the thousands of positive reviews raving about this product, but in order for us to truly believe it, we had to test it out for ourselves. So, we ordered a bunch of Breathe Green Charcoal Bags (which arrived at our door 3 days later) and started conducting tests.</p>
                    <h3>Test 1: The Smelly Trash Can</h3>
                    <p>We wanted to see if the Breathe Green Charcoal Bags could beat the stinky odors around a trash can. We threw all kinds of smelly food in the trash and let it sit for a few days. After a few days, food started to rot and the smell was pretty unbearable. We then placed a Breathe Green Charcoal Bag next to the trash can.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> After leaving the bag next to the trash can for 24 hours, we came back and were amazed to already find almost no foul stench coming from around the trash can. The best part was that it wasn&rsquo;t like using a scented deodorizer to mask the smell, but instead, the air just quickly began to smell fresh and on its way to quickly becoming odorless. Just a couple of days later we had the great results we were looking <span style="white-space:nowrap;">for.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <h3>Test 2: Smoking Indoors</h3>
                    <p>For our next test, we wanted to see if the <a class="articleLink" href="<?php echo $link ?>" onclick="fbq('trackCustom','CTA');">Breathe Green Charcoal Bags</a> could stand up to the harsh smell of cigarettes being smoked indoors. We conducted the test in a 500 square foot living room by putting 4 bags in each corner of the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">room.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> After smoking 1 cigarette and 24 hours later, we entered the living room and to our amazement, there was very little residue of cigarette smoke in the room. It was simply amazing!</p>
                    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> By the end of the week the living room was virtually odorless, but it is important to note that we could smell traces of cigarette smoke when we walked through other parts of the house that did not have the bags. If you want your entire house covered, you should get enough bags to place throughout your house.</p>
                    <h3>Test 3: The Bathroom/Shower</h3>
										<p>We took this next experiment to the bathroom where there is naturally a lot of moisture and mold/mildew growing. We placed just one bag in the bathroom while we turned up a hot shower for about 30 minutes several times a day, with all doors and windows shut so moisture could not escape. For 3 straight days, we repeated this process, each time keeping the doors and windows shut.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Experts say that it usually takes 24-48 hours for mold and mildew to start growing. After putting the bags through a rigorous 3-day test, we checked back each day to see if there was any presence of mold or mildew growing. Again, the results were amazing&hellip; no mold or mildew to be found anywhere! The bathroom did not even feel humid at all so we assume that the bag did its job by sucking up all the moisture, and thus successfully preventing mold from growing.</p>
                    <h3>Test 4: Doggy Daycare Facility</h3>
										<p>Our last test took place in a doggy daycare facility. With 18 dogs running around, naturally the facility had very strong dog odors. We placed about 30 bags throughout the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">facility.<sup><small>[4]</small></sup></span></p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> We came back 24 hours later and although we could still smell just a hint of dog odor throughout the facility, there was a HUGE improvement. This was an extreme case, and if used in a normal household environment with 1 or 2 dogs, we are confident that the Breathe Green Charcoal Bag would be able to combat these pet odors with no problem.</p>
                <h2>
                    Our Final Thoughts
                </h2>
                    <p>After conducting several tests, we are able to confirm that these Breathe Green Charcoal Bags really do work as well as everyone says. To be honest, we haven&rsquo;t seen anything like this on the market, and are truly blown away by how well it works. Whether you are looking to purify the air in your house, prevent mold from growing or protecting yourself from unpleasant odors, we would highly recommend <a class="articleLink" href="<?php echo $link ?>" onclick="fbq('trackCustom','CTA');">buying a few Breathe Green Charcoal Bags </a> to try out for <span style="white-space:nowrap;">yourself.<sup><small>[2]</small></sup></span></p>
										<p>But don&rsquo;t take our word for it. Listen to a mother who knows what it can do.</p>
										<p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; says Mary Johnson. &ldquo;If this thing can cleanse my shoe rack of that putrid smell, it will take care of pretty much any kind of odor you&rsquo;re dealing with. The fact is, it just works.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p><span style="color: #d00; font-weight: bold;">*Update: <?=date('F j, Y');?>*</span> - Ever since the <a class="articleLink" href="<?php echo $link ?>" onclick="fbq('trackCustom','CTA');">Breathe Green Charcoal Bags</a> were featured on TV, an incredible amount of buzz has been generated and has since sold many thousands of bags.
