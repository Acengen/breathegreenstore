            <div class="pl-4">
              <p>The future just got a whole lot brighter, if you’re someone who is looking for an environmentally safe product that contains a single all-natural ingredient that may be able to help you absorb moisture and other less-than-ideal elements from the air you breathe. This can result in giving you the tools you need to better protect your respiratory system, your blood and your lung health. The effects of this ingredient on your air could also lead to you having more energy and feeling much healthier in the process.<sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></p>
							<p>Here's why:</p>
							<p>Right now the moisture in your home, plus other factors such as odors and allergens produced by your beloved family pets are negatively affecting your health right now more than you realize…<sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></p>

								THE BREATHE GREEN ECO-FRIENDLY CHARCOAL BAG WORKS NATURALLY TO REDUCE MOISTURE, ODORS & ALLERGENS WHILE HELPING PREVENT MOLD, MILDEW, &amp; BACTERIA!<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>
							</p>
              <p>The sources of these pollutants in your home also come from items like damp, sweaty shoes & gym bags, moisture in your kitchen, car, closet, bathroom or any enclosed areas in your home and office.</p>
							<p>But unfortunately that’s not the end of the story. You probably didn’t realize that your house is filled with virtual landmines of harmful chemicals including formaldehyde, ammonia, benzene and chloroform gases emitted from such items as paint, carpeting, air fresheners, chemical cleaners, rubber and plastic.<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></p>

As air passes through the pores in the charcoal, odor, allergens and bacteria particles in the air are trapped on the surface, which in turn helps purify the air.
