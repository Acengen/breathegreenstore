                Americans Are Going Crazy Over This Simple Yet Powerful Solution That Attacks Odors, Mold, Mildew, Bacteria and Allergens</div>
            <div id="articleDate">
                Thursday, November 28th, 2019 | By Rita Hatthaway

            <h3>
                If you could naturally protect your home from odors, mold, bacteria and allergens without any extra work, would you do it? Millions of Americans are doing just that, thanks to the brand new Breathe Green Charcoal Bag.
						</h3>

                <p>Would it surprise you to know that the air you're breathing indoors can be up to 5 times worse than the air outside? Whether you have mold/mildew problems, a smelly trash can, smoke indoors, a house full of pets or a stinky closet, we could all use cleaner, fresher and purer air inside our homes.</p>
                <p>Up until now, the only solutions available were to use harsh chemical deodorizers, sprays, candles or gels. Furthermore, none of these actually eliminate the problem but instead only cover up or mask the problem.</p>
                <p>Luckily, there is finally a new solution called the Breathe Green Charcoal that actually helps manage the problem without using harsh <span style="white-space:nowrap;">chemicals.<sup><small>[6]</small></sup></span></p>


            <h1>
                The clever little trick (backed by science) that cleanses the air inside your home…
            </h1>

                <p>The Breathe Green Charcoal comes in the form of a bag and is the easiest, most convenient way to support a fresh, dry and odor free environment. Made of just one incredibly powerful natural ingredient, activated bamboo charcoal, the Breathe Green Charcoal is continuously working to effectively absorb and reduce odors, allergens and harmful pollutants and to aid in your efforts to clean and freshen the air.</p>
                <p>The activated bamboo charcoal neutralizes even stubborn smells, such as those caused by smoke, pet urine, cat litter boxes, wet dogs, gym shoes and more. The Breathe Green Charcoal Bag is also excellent for use in damp, musty environments, where it will absorb excess moisture to help prevent mold, mildew and bacteria from <span style="white-space:nowrap;">forming.<sup><small>[1]</small></sup></span></p>
                <p>And unlike harsh chemical deodorizers and sprays, the <a class="articleLink" href="<?=$link;?>";>Breathe Green Charcoal Bag</a> is a chemical free, fragrance free and non-toxic natural odor absorber made to help keep you and your pets <span style="white-space:nowrap;">safe.<sup><small>[6]</small></sup></span></p>
                <p>Best of all, it’s super easy to use. Simply place the bag on any surface and it will start purifying the air around it for up to 90 square feet and lasts up to 2 years.</p>
                <div class="articleImg">
                    <center><img src="images/naturefresh-combo.jpg" width="100%" /></center>

            <h1>
                With many thousands of bags already sold, we had to try it out for ourselves…
            </h1>

                <p>We’ve read the thousands of positive reviews raving about this product, but in order for us to truly believe it, we had to test it out for ourselves. So, we ordered a bunch of Breathe Green Charcoal Bags (which arrived at our door 3 days later) and started conducting tests.</p>
                
                <h3>Test 1: The Smelly Trash Can</h3>

                <p>We wanted to see if the Breathe Green Charcoal Bags could beat the stinky odors around a trash can. We threw all kinds of smelly food in the trash and let it sit for a few days. After a few days, food started to rot and the smell was pretty unbearable. We then placed a Breathe Green Charcoal Bag next to the trash can.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> After leaving the bag next to the trash can for 24 hours, we came back and were amazed to already find almost no foul stench coming from around the trash can. The best part was that it wasn’t like using a scented deodorizer to mask the smell, but instead, the air just quickly began to smell fresh and on its way to quickly becoming odorless. Just a couple of days later we had the great results we were looking <span style="white-space:nowrap;">for.<sup><small>[6]</small></sup></span></p>
                
                <h3>Test 2: Smoking Indoors</h3>

                <p>For our next test, we wanted to see if the <a class="articleLink" href="<?=$link;?>";>Breathe Green Charcoal Bags</a> could stand up to the harsh smell of cigarettes being smoked indoors. We conducted the test in a 500 square foot living room by putting 4 bags in each corner of the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">the air.<sup><small>[6]</small></sup></span></p>
                
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> After smoking 1 cigarette and 24 hours later, we entered the living room and to our amazement, there was very little residue of cigarette smoke in the room. It was simply amazing!</p>
                
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> By the end of the week the living room was virtually odorless, but it is important to note that we could smell traces of cigarette smoke when we walked through other parts of the house that did not have the bags. If you want your entire house covered, you should get enough bags to place throughout your house.</p>
                
                <h3>Test 3: The Bathroom/Shower</h3>

                 <p>We took this next experiment to the bathroom where there is naturally a lot of moisture and mold/mildew growing. We placed just one bag in the bathroom while we turned up a hot shower for about 30 minutes several times a day, with all doors and windows shut so moisture could not escape. For 3 straight days, we repeated this process, each time keeping the doors and windows <span style="white-space:nowrap;">shut.<sup><small>[6]</small></sup></span></p>
                
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Experts say that it usually takes 24-48 hours for mold and mildew to start growing. After putting the bags through a rigorous 3-day test, we checked back each day to see if there was any presence of mold or mildew growing. Again, the results were amazing… no mold or mildew to be found anywhere! The bathroom did not even feel humid at all so we assume that the bag did its job by sucking up all the moisture, and thus successfully preventing mold from growing.</p>
                
                <h3>Test 4: Doggy Daycare Facility</h3>

                 <p>Our last test took place in a doggy daycare facility. With 18 dogs running around, naturally the facility had very strong dog odors. We placed about 30 bags throughout the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">facility.<sup><small>[8]</small></sup></span></p>
                
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> We came back 24 hours later and although we could still smell just a hint of dog odor throughout the facility, there was a HUGE improvement. This was an extreme case, and if used in a normal household environment with 1 or 2 dogs, we are confident that the Breathe Green Charcoal Bag would be able to combat these pet odors with no problem.</p>

            <h1>
                Our Final Thoughts
            </h1>

                <p>After conducting several tests, we are able to confirm that these Breathe Green Charcoal Bags really do work as well as everyone says. To be honest, we haven’t seen anything like this on the market, and are truly blown away by how well it works. Whether you are looking to purify the air in your house, prevent mold from growing or protecting yourself from unpleasant odors, we would highly recommend <a class="articleLink" href="<?=$link;?>";>buying a few Breathe Green Charcoal Bags</a> to try out for <span style="white-space:nowrap;">yourself.<sup><small>[6]</small></sup></span></p>
